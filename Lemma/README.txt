VR Instructions
===============

- If you are a Steam user, do one of the following:

	- Open Steam in VR mode and run the game from there
	- Or, right-click the game in your library, hit "Properties",
	  then hit "Set launch options" and enter "-vr"

- For non-Steam users, run the "Lemma VR" shortcut. This just passes
  the "-vr" argument to the game for you.

- If the game boots up on the wrong screen, use
  Windows + Shift + Left/right arrow key to move it to the Oculus.
